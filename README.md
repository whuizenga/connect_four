# Connect Four

## Project Description
Connect Four is a classic table top game for children. The object of the game is to line up four pieces in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Players alternate turns placing a chip at the bottom of the stack. The first to make a line of four is the winner!

I thought out the logic for checking wins on a white board.
